### What I Learned💡

- **Breaking down complex forms into manageable steps:** I learned that multi-step forms can significantly improve user engagement and reduce form abandonment by breaking down complex data collection processes into smaller, more manageable steps.

- **Implementing data validation with React Hook Form:** I gained experience in utilizing React Hook Form to effectively validate user inputs, ensuring data integrity and preventing invalid submissions.

- **Leveraging Redux Toolkit for state management:** I explored the power of Redux Toolkit for managing the form's state, facilitating consistent data handling and easy updates.
